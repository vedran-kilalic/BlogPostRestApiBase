I want to present to you my Crud Rest API that I made in these 7 days. 
I want to say right away that in my opinion this was not an easy task because I have never worked in the ASP.NET framework before and,I can say that I really liked this technology and I learned a lot.
The reason i selected this techonlogy is because i had previous expiriences with Java's framework Spring Boot. 
I used Visual Studio 2022 as my text editor.

As for the task itself, the task is not completed. 
All CRUD operations have been successfully written and work perfectly. 
The challenge I ran into was connecting to the database which I ended up not being able to do. 
I used SQL Server Management Studio in which I did not have the ability to edit tables, which ultimately led to the task not being finalized.
Also i tried using MYSQL Workbench but the package I nedeed to install says it is depricated so i did not know how to implement that. 
Also i installed SQL express as my server. Packages that i installed were Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore , Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design , Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer. 
I also tested my everything in Postman as well in Swagger.

I hope you will find time to take a look at this.
